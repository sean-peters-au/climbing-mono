Betaboard is an over-engineered, over-the-top climbing board app. It is very in progress.

[![Under Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/under-development-orange.svg)](https://github.com/cez-aug/github-project-boilerplate) 

The goal is to
- Track 3 axes forces applied over climbing holds, and skeletal kinematics of the climber
- 3D visualisation of the forces and climber on the board
- Biomechanics approximations from this time-series data
