The backend is a Python Flask application that provides RESTful APIs for wall management, route creation, sensor data handling, and analysis. It handles the core business logic, database interactions, and integration with external services.

### Core Concepts

- **Wall Management**: Creation, retrieval, and updating of climbing walls.
- **Route Management**: Definition and management of climbing routes.
- **Sensor Data Handling**: Collection and processing of real-time sensor data from climbing holds.
- **Recording and Analysis**: Storage and analysis of climb recordings.
- **External Services Integration**: Interaction with services like Amazon S3 and image processing services.

### Design Patterns

1. **Layered Architecture**

   - **routes/**: Define the RESTful API endpoints.
   - **business/logic/**: Contains the core operations and business rules.
   - **business/models/**: Business models as simple python data classes
   - **db/dao/**: Provide an abstraction layer over database operations.
   - **db/schema/**: Define the database models using SQLAlchemy ORM.
   - **services/**: Integrate with external services (e.g., S3, image processing).
   - **utils/**: Common helpers and configurations.

2. **Separation of Concerns**

   - Clear separation between layers to promote maintainability and scalability.
   - **DAOs**: Only interact with the database schemas.
   - **Business Models**: Independently defined data models that do not depend on DAOs.
   - **Business Logic**: Acts as an intermediary, orchestrating between models and DAOs.

3. **Dependency Isolation**

   - **Routes** depend on **Business Logic**.
   - **Business Logic** depends on **Business Models** and **DAOs**.
   - **DAOs** depend on **Database Schemas**.
   - This isolation ensures changes in one layer have minimal impact on others.

### Toolset

- **Framework**: Python Flask
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy ORM, and Alembic for migrations
- **Data Serialization**: Marshmallow
